# Convolutional Neural Networks Projects 🧠

This repository contains information about three convolutional neural network projects addressing different detection problems: emotions, tumors, and COVID-19 (using transfer learning). 😁

## Project 1: Emotion Detection 😫😓😑😭😛😡🥶

### Description▶️
This project focuses on detecting emotions in facial images using convolutional neural networks. The network was trained on a diverse dataset of facial expressions acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/). It can classify images into different emotion categories such as 'surprise', 'fear', 'angry', 'neutral', 'sad', 'disgust', 'happy'. 🧠

## Project 2: Tumor Detection 🧠

### Description▶️
This project focuses on tumor detection in medical images using convolutional neural networks. The model was trained on a dataset of medical scanner images and can identify the presence of tumors in X-ray or magnetic resonance images. The dataset was acquired from the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/).

## Project 3: COVID-19 Detection with Transfer Learning🧠

### Description▶️
This project utilizes transfer learning to detect COVID-19 cases in chest X-rays. It leverages a pre-trained model on a large medical dataset and fine-tunes it specifically for COVID-19 detection. This allows for accurate detection even with a limited dataset. The limited dataset was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset/ 🌐
